1)	When passing an array to a function is it "by address" or "by value" ? explain what happens and what is meant by the two terms.
2)	By value is I can make a copy in memory of the parameter's value
    parameter's value is passed in that a copy of the contents of the actual parameter. I can use by value when I need to use parameter in computation. And I can use it for don¡¯t make any change for client program 
in by address a copy of the address is stored. I can use it for make change in client program.
 
3)	Explain why functions with an array parameter are usually complemented with an additional integer parameter (reference specifics in this workshop to explain your answer).
4)	
because integer values can be arbitrarily large
 
3) Why do some of the functions in this workshop specify "const" for the array parameters and not in others?
Const can designate type and to don¡¯t make any change in  value.
